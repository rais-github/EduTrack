# EduTrack: Visualizing Course Sales by Continent and Topic

## Description:

EduTrack is a data visualization project aimed at tracking the sales performance of an organization offering classroom and online courses across different continents and topics. Developed using D3.js or a similar library, the project provides interactive pie charts to visualize sales data by country, continent, and course topic. Additionally, users can explore detailed information about enrolled students for each course.

## Features:

1. **Continent-wise Sales Visualization:** Display a pie chart showing the distribution of course sales across continents, allowing users to hover over each segment to view sales percentages and total revenue.
2. **Topic-wise Sales Analysis:** Provide separate pie charts for each course topic (e.g., AI, Web, Android) within the online courses category, showcasing the proportion of sales for each topic relative to total online/offline course sales. Multiple topics/subjects should be included.
3. **Classroom vs. Online Sales Comparison:** Present a comparative visualization of sales between classroom and online courses, illustrating the revenue share and growth trends for each vertical. Filters available for months and years.
4. **Student Enrollment Details:** Allow users to access a detailed list of enrolled students for each course, including their names, contact information, enrollment dates, and course progress.
5. **Interactive User Interface:** Create an intuitive user interface with interactive features such as tooltips, zooming of video, and filtering options to enhance the user experience and facilitate data exploration.
6. **Responsive Design:** Ensure the project is responsive and accessible across multiple devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones, to accommodate users with different preferences and screen sizes.
7. **Data Security and Privacy:** Implement measures to protect sensitive student information, such as encryption, access controls, and data anonymization, to comply with privacy regulations and maintain data integrity.
8. **Hackathon-ready Solution:** Package the project with clear instructions for setup, configuration, and customization, enabling high school students to quickly deploy and present their visualization solution during hackathons or competitions.
